Central is the central communictation server inside carmen. Therefore,
the first thing you need to do is to start central. Without this
server, no CARMEN module will work. In order to tell you module which
server it should connect to, you have to specify the CENTRALHOST environment
variable using

<h3> setenv CENTRALHOST localhost <h3>  
or
<h3> export CENTRALHOST=localhost <h3>  
depending on the shell you are using.

BUGS reported by Greg 
========================================

- robotgraph -- when turning to face a point, and the network goes out, robot
keeps turning for 1-3 secs. Why?

TODO
======================================== 

backwards_flag -- i don't understand how the backwards_flag can possibly
work. in scout, if backwards_flag is on, the robot will go backwards when the
backwards_flag is on with positive velocity, but the x term of the odometry
will go down. 

acceleration/deceleration -- i don't believe that the pioneer actually has
separate fields for these two things. it has pioneer_seta and pioneer_setra
fields, but these things aren't being treated correctly by the pioneer
module. who knows what they mean?

all -- add handlers so that query/response is possible

all base modules -- none of them set the acceleration field of the odometry
message correctly. This needs to be fixed.

param_edit -- can't create parameters
	      need to be able to create new carmen.ini from scratch.

add reading functions to logger_io.

sonar/ir/bumper: should be a method to request current configurations. 

No way to zero odometry right now, should be a way.

logger  ---  add param change recording to logger, and param change playback
	        to playback

navigator -- check cost function building.  
	     check loop speed on amelia.
	     check vector control loop -- distance calculation seems 
             screwed up. 

map_editor -- no support for pixel offlimits.
	no support for deleting offlimits.
	no support for undo while creating offlimits.

maps -- offlimits not handled properly by minimize/rotate -- possibly other
programs?

map_read -- fix buffer size problem with username/origin/description
            fields in cmrt_map_read_creator_chunk, and null problem
	          with creation_time field
	    
navigator -- occupied cell problem

logger -- version stamping
          logger usage statement
	  logger core dumps on control C on reid\'s computer

robot -- backwards control loop
         XR4000 control loop

robotgraph -- robotgraph segfaults on joystick stuff on reids computer.  

localize -- testing
	    people adding & removing

mapeditor --- better usage statements

----------------------------------------

DONE base holonomic message 
	
DONE cleanup localize output

DONE fix param processing of robot name 

DONE fix navigator_graphics

DONE fix navigator conventional priority queue

DONE integrate xavier code

DONE combine robot and control loop

DONE remove base_velocity usage

DONE add error checks to navigator param handling. 

DONE printing out a warning if the param serving fails?

DONE Turns out that everywhere you call Generate_next_motion_command, it is 
followed immediately by a "send_base_velocity" command.  You might want to 
just combine the two, for simplicity's sake.

DONE change subscribe messages to set queue to be 1, or 0.

DONE remove robot_odometry_{front/rear}_laser messages

DONE base -- remove drive-to-point 
	     remove acceleration commands

DONE robot --  stop hitting stuff

DONE navigator -- plan implementation on real robot

DONE paramServer -- subscribe to changes
		    add warning if there's an unused/unrecognised command line argument
		    uniform usage messages

DONE logger -- param recording
	       get logger parameters from paramServer

DONE Fix in all programs -- could not connect to central message.

DONE pioneer -- timestamps

DONE navigator -- arrived at goal message
	          other stop message
		  allow moving goals
DONE pioneer -- interpolation problem
                threaded
	        acceleration setup
	        integrate with paramServer

DONE makefiles -- make debug

DONE ant -- fix bugs (changed to ant_lite)
            remove ant interfaces from low-level programs

DONE joystick -- use paramServer
	         better usage
		 integrate with robotgraph

DONE robot -- add collision avoidance on backwards motion

DONE simulator -- integrate robot and simulator
                  fix with graphics

DONE simulator -- rear laser simulation has a weird offset problem

DONE simulator -- person simulation has a weird offset problem 
                  when robot is very close to person, and robot rotates,
                  person rotates to stay in field-of-view.

DONE navigator -- wrong map sent at startup
	          tracking problem

DONE all -- convert all floats to doubles

DONE <ctrl-c> in robotgraph window causes robot to start moving.  

DONE cursor position for moving robot vs. turning robot isn\'t quite
right. robot will move with cursor close to robot, but not in it. maybe robot
should light up when ready to move.

DONE convert all units to MKS (ie. cm -> m)

DONE modify aaai interface to be three argumented (void *)handler(ptr *),
ptr *, subscribe flags (ALL|LATEST|ETC)

DONE modify carmen include files so that C++ is handled properly

DONE version numbering -- check for inconsistency among modules

DONE paramServer -- barfs when reid supplies a param file and not a map file

DONE graphics -- make all non-graphics programs compile without gtk/gnome	

DONE navigator --  timing redraws  

DONE navigator_panel -- add localize displays

DONE ipc messages -- should have cmrt/carmen prepended.

DONE Needs a joystick off argument

DONE makefiles -- make install

DONE remove the pioneer_messages.h and scout_messages.h files.

DONE logger -- write a program to read params from logfile and install them.

DONE localize -- patched localization bug in perception update

DONE map_graphics.c -- patched memory leak.

DONE Makefiles -- An old version of Debian didn't have tcpd.h, and thus didn't
support tcp wrappers at all.  It also didn't have libjpeg.a.  I had to comment
out the tcp wrapper access control in Ant.  Maybe the Makefile should try to
detect this.  Maybe not.

DONE localize -- why is there no x/theta covariance, y/theta covariance?
	         Mike says because no one needs it. 

DONE *interface.c -- patched msg queue length to be max 100, so that
		     central can never choke.

Also patched localize_ipc to subscribe to latest localize_initialize message.
Patched logger to subscribe to latest sync message, and latest param change
message.
Patched playback to subscribe to latest playback command.
mapserver subscribes to last 100 map requests
paramserver subscribes to last 100 param requests
robot/pioneer/scout/rflex/xr4000 respond to last velocity command, vector move
command 

DONE make base_services and laser more robust to hardware stopping and
restarting.

DONE laser -- startup problem RS422 interface

DONE -- multiline string literals paramserver and map_editor.

DONE -- base_messages: fix bumper message field num_sonars to num_bumpers.

DONE -- hard to tell when parameter has been set.

DONE -- simulator -- fix motion error model in simulator.
